# Final Project for CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Design and Analysis 
The following questions are being used to aid in the reflection of this assignment.

#### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The advisors at the fictional ABC University needed a program that assisted them in advising students by allowing them to print all the available courses and search for a particular course. 
#### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The program needed to parse a file, and then store it in a data structure in order to solve the problem.  An understanding of different data structures allowed me to choose what I believed to be the most appropriate data structure: a binary search tree.
#### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
At one point, my program was outputting very odd characters.  I was quick to reach out to my peers, and one of them suggested testing other files.  Sure enough, it turned out that the original file was corrupt, and I could carry on with my work after that realization.  
#### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The milestones (pseudocode) preceeded the actual project.  I realized through this project that pseudocode can prove very helpful in organizing your thoughts.  With my pseudocode, my time spent coding was very efficient.
#### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program utilized a lot of functions, which makes it easier to troubleshoot should there be a problem later on.  It also reduced the number of times code was repeated, helping make the code much more readable.
